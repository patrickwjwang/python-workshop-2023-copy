# Berkeley Statistics Python Workshop, 2023
Materials for Python short course for incoming Statistics grad students.

## Schedule

The workshop will be in Evans 332.

 - Introduction to Python: 9 am - 1:30 pm Wednesday Aug. 16.
 - Project work: 9 am - 1:30 pm Thursday Aug. 17.

We'll provide a few snacks, but given the somewhat late end time, feel free to bring your own and some lunch if you expect to be hungry.

## Content

The workshop content is in Markdown in `python.qmd` with a rendered HTML version in `python.html` and an Jupyter notebook version in `python.ipynb`. The mini-project material is in `project.qmd/project.html/project.ipynb`. The `qmd` files are the new-ish Quarto format, but are basically simple Markdown files with Python code chunks interspersed.

To download the materials on your computer, you have two options:

 - clone this GitHub repository (if you are familiar with Git)
 - download [this zip file](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/python-workshop-2023/archive/gh-pages.zip)

We'll primarily be directly working with the Python code in the Markdown or notebook versions of the files, but you can see static HTML versions:
 
  - [Day 1: Intro to Python](python.html)
  - [Day 2: Project](project.html)

## Instructions for accessing Python

The only, but important, preparation in advance of the bootcamp is to make sure you have access to Python, with key packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels) that we'll use during the bootcamp.

Whether you run Python (or IPython) through the command line or via a Jupyter Notebook doesn't matter.

In the workshop, I'll primarily use both approaches.

Below are a couple options for having access to Python. Please make sure at least one of these works for you before you arrive at the short course. The last two options require a computing account with the department through the Statistical Computing Facility, which you request here:
https://scf.berkeley.edu/account

  - (1) Download and install [Anaconda (Python 3.11 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your laptop. Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

  - (2) Use the [UC Berkeley DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) to access Python via Jupyter notebooks. You can launch a Jupyter session that has access to the workshop materials [here](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fberkeley-scf%2Fpython-workshop-2023&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fpython-workshop-2023%2F). Then just double-click on the `python.ipynb` file in the left pane and it should open in a notebook.
 
 
If you have an SCF account, you have a couple more options:

  - (3) [SSH to any SCF Linux machine](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh) and run Python from the command line. 

  - (4) Login to the [SCF JupyterHub](https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu) (using your SCF username and password) to access a Jupyter IPython notebook. Further instructions are [here](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/jupyterhub).
